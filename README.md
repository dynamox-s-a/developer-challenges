## Welcome to my solution of the full-stack challenge of Dynamox

<hr>

First of all, since the original readme was written in English, I'll do the same here to document my effort through this project.

I am currently writing this first version of documentation @ 11:00 AM on Thursday, Oct 24. I'll make a commit right after I finish here to save it as the timestamp of the beginning of this journey.

My chain of thoughts can be read [here](/thoughts.md). I'll leave my resources table below that I came up after elaborating about the project:

<div align="center">
  <a href="/assets/image.png" target="_blank">
      <img src="/assets/image.png" alt="Relations Table" width="250">
  </a>
</div>

Stack that I'll use:

- TS, Next, Redux, MUI;
- Node, TS, Nest, Prisma, PostgreSQL;
- Nx for managing the repo;
- Jest.
