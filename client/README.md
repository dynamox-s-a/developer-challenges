# Machine Management System

A full-stack machine and monitoring points management application built with Next.js, Express.js, and TypeScript. The frontend uses the suggested Devias Kit. I've added two new pages: Machines and Monitoring Points which can be accesses via side-menu.

## My assumptions given requirements specs:
- Whenever a machine type is updated, all its related monitoring points must be deleted. This avoids creating invalid state with machines set invalid sensor types.
- Machines and Monitoring points must have a internal UUID. This allows keeping reference of entities as users change its properties.
- State validation in frontend improves user experience (feedbacks with toasts, invalid forms, etc) but the server is the business rules guard. That's why server validates incoming state by instancing domain objects with it (machines of certain type, monitoring points, etc).
- For reading purposes it's enough to simply fetch data from database (in the sense of CQRS).

## Known limitations:
- Persistence layer is currenly in-memory only. But having clear repository modules makes it simple to implement it. One could create an interface from current repositories and implement them as required for a SQL stack.
- The interface between server and client is very manual as it is, and because of that, very error prone. Improving this would be a huge quality-of-life improvement.
- Frontend works, but it could improve in its design. Also, current implementation fetches all user data at the same time. If a user has too many machines and monitoring points, a proper server-side pagination handling would improve performance.

## Data Models

### Machine Types
- **Pump**: Industrial pumps with specific sensor compatibility
- **Fan**: Industrial fans with specific sensor compatibility

### Sensor Types
- **TcAg**: Temperature sensors (compatible with fan machines only, **forbidden** for pump machines)
- **TcAs**: Humidity sensors (compatible with fan machines only, **forbidden** for pump machines)
- **HFPlus**: Pressure sensors (compatible with pump machines only)

### Business Rules
1. **Machine Type Change**: When a machine type is changed, all associated monitoring points are automatically deleted
2. **Sensor Compatibility**: Strict validation ensures only compatible sensor types can be added to machines:
   - **Pump machines**: Can ONLY have HFPlus (pressure) sensors
   - **Pump machines FORBIDDEN**: TcAg and TcAs sensors are explicitly forbidden for pump machines
   - **Fan machines**: Can have TcAg (temperature) and TcAs (humidity) sensors
   - **Invalid combinations** return detailed error messages explaining compatibility requirements
3. **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own machines and monitoring points
4. **Cascade Deletion**: Deleting a machine removes all its monitoring points
5. **Validation on Creation**: Monitoring points are validated for compatibility before creation

## Authentication

The application uses JWT-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies:

1. **Registration/Login**: Sets secure HTTP-only cookie
2. **API Requests**: Cookie automatically included with `credentials: 'include'`
3. **Protected Routes**: Server validates JWT on protected endpoints
4. **Logout**: Clears authentication cookie

## Testing
The backend server has unit and integration tests. They are not abosolutely comprehensive, but cover the major use cases.   
```bash
cd server
npm run test
```

## Production Deployment

1. **Build the client:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Build the server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Set production environment variables**
4. **Deploy both applications to your hosting platform**
